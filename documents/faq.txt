AI Assistant Overview

UdayKiran is an intelligent personal assistant designed to respond to voice and text queries. It can fetch data from internal memory and external document sources to give contextual answers.

Key Features:
- Emotion detection via webcam
- Real-time transcription of voice input
- Integration with local or remote LLMs like DeepSeek
- Memory of past user interactions

Development Stack:
- PyQt5 for GUI
- LangChain + ChromaDB for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Sentence-Transformer for embeddings
- Local LLM via HTTP (e.g., Ollama or DeepSeek API)

FAQs:
Q: Can UdayKiran respond to both voice and text input?
A: Yes, it supports both microphone and keyboard-based interactions.

Q: How does RAG improve answer quality?
A: RAG retrieves relevant text from local documents and feeds it into the LLM prompt, grounding the response.

Q: Is internet required to use UdayKiran?
A: No, it can run fully offline with a local model and vector store.

Q: What happens if a document isn't found?
A: UdayKiran falls back to memory or just uses the LLM directly.

Tips:
- Put `.txt` documents in the `documents/` folder
- Run `init_rag.py` to refresh the vector DB
- You can ask, “What is LangChain?” or “How does RAG help?” to test
